PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
NODE_ENV=development

## 📖 Usage Instructions
- **Creating Contracts & Invoices:** Use the "Create Contract" button on the contract page and the "Create Invoice" button on the invoice page.
- **Admin Setup:** Before using the frontend, create an admin user using Postman:
  1. Use the API to create a user with the admin role.
  2. Log in using that admin account from the frontend.

*Without this step, the system may not function as expected.*

---

## 🔑 Roles & Permissions
- **Admin:** Full access (manage users, contracts, and invoices).
- **User:** Can only create and view contracts/invoices. No edit or delete permissions.

---

## 🌐 API Documentation
- Users can refer to the backend route files for available API endpoints.
- A Postman collection can be generated by referring to the backend schema models.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implement a client portal where companies under contract can view their contracts, invoices, and make direct payments.
- Enhance existing features and introduce more automation in invoice tracking and payments.
